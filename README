You are in the NetFPGA 10G empty repository.

This is a placeholder repository.

It permits a publicly accessable wiki

at

https://github.com/NetFPGA-10G/NetFPGA-10G-empty/wiki


Which in turn contains the entry and registration instructions for
the NetFPGA 10G


Sorry for the maze of twisty passages; its an easy way to have a
customized front door that points you at the registration page.
